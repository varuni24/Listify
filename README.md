Listify is a to-do app built using Redux. It allows users to allows users to create/manage multiple to-do lists. Users can click on a specific to-do list to view and manage its associated tasks by adding, editing or deleting their tasks. They can also mark tasks as completed and see the list of incompleted tasks. With its user-friendly interface, Listify enables individuals to create their to-do lists and manage their time and tasks in an efficient manner

This project was made in order to apply my learning of React Redux. 

## Features

- **Add a new to-do list**: Create a new to-do list by entering the title of the to-do list
